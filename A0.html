<h2>Assignment 0: Investigating Photo Distortion</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Human face from far and near</h3>
<p>
    We had to take a picture one of our friends from close up (and note the distortions), 
    and then for far away, zoomed in.<br>
    Here are the images, the first taken from close up without zoom and the second from a distance with zoom:</p>

    width="300">
    </center>
<h4>Why is it distorted?</h4>
<p>
    My intuition about this distortion is that when close up, the ratio/between the distances of
    different parts of the face and the camera is much more significant, since the overall the face's 
    distance from the camera is small (i.e distance vertical to plane of camera lense) and because objects that are relatively close to the camera appear bigger.
    So, when you take a close up photo the nose, for example, will be so much closer to the camera than the rest of the face that it looks 
    huge. The minute differenes between the elavations of particular parts of the face, become more significant. <br>
    On the other hand, when the whole face is farther away, these minute differences in the elivation of the face
    become neglegible in comaprison to the total distance of the face from the camera, the face effectively becomes a flat plane.
</p>
<p>
    To illustrate the point about size distrotion and distances between the camera and objects, Lets assume that the camera is a pinhole
    camera (they are not really) like what was discussed in class. Here is the relavant diagram from the slides:
</p>

<p>
    Say that there are 2 object, A and B, whose height is the same (1 meter), and they are 1 meter apart from 
    eachother on the x-axis. <br>
    Say we take two different pictures each with the same focal distance f=1m,
    first with a camera placed such that its distance from A is Z<sub>A1</sub>=1 meter and distance from B 
    is Z<sub>B1</sub>=2 meters. Here we see that the height of A y<sub>A1</sub>=-(-1)*1/1=1m and the height
    of B is y<sub>A1</sub>=-(-1)*1/2=0.5m. Thus the difference in the heights of A and B in this picutre is 0.5m
    <br><br>
    Now say that we take a second picure where the same campera is placed such that its distance from A is 
    Z<sub>A2</sub>=10 meters, and from B is Z<sub>B2</sub>=11 meters. How the heights in the image are 
    y<sub>A1</sub>=-(-1)*1/10=0.1m, and y<sub>A1</sub>=-(-1)*1/11=0.09m. Only a difference in height of 0.01m in the picture.
</p>
<p>
    How does this work with the face? Lets assume My face is a flat plane except for my nose. My face is about 21 cm tall, 
    the tip of my nose is elivated by about 2 cm, and my nose is about 5cm tall (probably innacurate measurement)
    (for simplicity ignore the sloped shape of the nose). So (assuming focal distance of 1cm) if I take a photo of myself 
    with the camera 15cm away from the plane of my face, my head would appear -(-21)*1/15=1.4cm tall in the image, while my nose
    will appear -(-5)*1/12=0.42cm tall.<br>
    If I took the image from 1000cm away instead, the heights would be -(-21)*1/1000=0.021, and -(-5)*1/998=0.005
    (to 2 d.p).<br>
    In the first image, the ratio of my face length:nose length= 1.4/0.42=3.33 while in the second it would be 0.021/0.005=4.2, 
    which is propably a noticable difference and matches what we see in the real images.

<h3>Part 2: Long path</h3>
<p>
    Here we where meant to capture a scene of a long path, first from far, zoomed in and then from normally
    from a close distance. Here are the two resulting images:
</p>

    <img src="FarPath.jpeg" alt="A0 part 2 far"
    width="300">
    <img src="ClosePath.jpeg" alt="A0 part 2 close"
    width="300">
</center>
<h4>Why is the first image flat looking?</h4>
<p>
    As mentioned previously, when taking a photo from far away with zoom, the discrepancies of size between objects 
    closer and farther away from the camera (where closer objects appear larger) decreases because the distance between objects and eachother
    relative to the distance between the objects and the camera decreases.<br>
    See how in the first image, the diference between the size of the path in the bottom of the picture/foreground and the top of the picture/background 
    is less compared to the size difference seen in the second picture. See also that the trash cans seem larger compared to the rest 
    of the image in the second picture compared to the first, even though the trashcans have relatively similar positions in the frames of
    both pictures overall.<br>
    This discrepancy in sizes according to distance may cause undesired distortions as seen in the first section,
    but it also gives a sense of depth to the image, as for the human eye closer objects appear larger as well. Thus,
    the zoomed in image taken from far appears flatter.
</p>
<h3>Part 3: Chair in orthographic and perspective projection</h3>
<p>
    Here we were meant to capture a picture of some object (a chair) in both perspective and orthographich projection.
    To obtain the orthographic projection, I took a zoomed in photo of the chair from a distance, and for the perspective
    projection I took a regular photo from close up.<br>
    Then we were to draw lines to highlight the straight edges. Here are the resultant pictures, first the perspective and then
    the orthographic:
