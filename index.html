<p>Hi! This is my webpage for hosting the non-technical asssignments for CS-4912: Computer Vision.</p>
<h2>Assignment 0: Investigating Photo Distortion</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Human face from far and near</h3>
<p>
    Here we had to take a picture one of out friends from close up (and note the distorttions), 
    and then for far away, zoomed in.<br>
    Here is the first image, taken from close up with not zoom:<br>

    And here is the second:<br>

<h4>Why is it distorted?</h4>
<p>
    [INSERT EXPLAINIATION]
    From my understanding, before reseaarching my intuituion is that the distortion is due to the angle at which light
    rays from the face will hit the camera. From close by, the ray paths from the face to the lens would be much more acute
    while from far the rays follow a gentler, almost parallel slope. I think that this would cause distortion because
    in the letter case, things that are equal distance apart will have thier light rays reach the camera roughly equal
    distance apart since the rays will be near parallel, but in the latter case the ray path becomes more and more inclined
    as you move away from the center of the camera causing discrepancies between actual distance between things, and distance 
    between the lightrays when they reach the lens. Diagram bellow to illustrate point.<br>
